   - Data Parallelism
- Hadoop ecosystem
- Spark
- Dask: [Dask](https://dask.org/) is an open-source parallel computing framework written natively in Python (initially released 2014). It has a significant following and support largely due to its good integration with the popular Python ML ecosystem triumvirate that is NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
